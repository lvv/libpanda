Abstract for the Australian Open Source Symposium 2000

Panda, a PDF generation API in embryonic state
----------------------------------------------

For the last couple of months I have been developing in my own time a PDF generation API called Panda. I have been developing this library because there is no free library to perform this functionality -- there are open source libraries, but they have their quirks and all have commercial use licenses. I have also developed a fair bit of expertise about the PDF specification during my employment at IPAustralia.

The intention of this presentation is to introduce the developer community to Panda, and elicit feedback about the design and operation of the library.

Panda is available at http://www.stillhq.com/panda/ and is licensed under the GPL.
