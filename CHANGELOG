Release 0.2 -> Release 0.3
  * Changed Makefile.in so that includes are looked for in /usr/include and
  	/usr/local/include

  * Added JPEG support to imagebox

  * Got colour JPEG working as well

  * Started to implement the pdf lexer so that we can open and then modify
	existing documents. This also aids in the reverse engineering
	required for the development of linearized (optomised) pdf

  * Implemented better use of autoconf

  * Changed the return value of adddictitem from a void to a dictionary *.
	This should not affect existing users because of the change from void,
	but allows the lexer to easily manipulate the pdf document as it
	reads it in.

  * Added the suppressed pdfopen option for the benefit of the lexer. This will
	not affect existing users.

  * Fixed erroneous image placement code which resulted in unpredictable image
	location on pages

  * Fixed a libjpeg usage bug that was causing memory corruption...
