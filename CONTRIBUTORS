CORPORATE SPONSORS

The following organisations have funded development on the Panda codebase. This
development has been released back to the community, and is included in this
distribution, which is cool to see...

IPAustralia     http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au

                The Australian federal body responsible for the issue and
                administration of Patents, Trade Marks and Designs. They funded
                the MS Windows port of Panda, including the development of the
                C DLL, the Visual Basic examples, the ActiveX DLL (0.4) and the
                installer.

TOWER Software	http://www.towersoft.com.au

		This Australian EDMS and Records Management vendor funded
		the continued development of the Microsoft Windows port of
		Panda. This includes the COM wrapper which was released with
		Panda 0.5...

Ben Elliston                              provided advice whenever I needed it,
                                          also heaps of support with autoconf
                                          and automake

Ceasar Miquel   miquel@df.uba.ar          submitted patches for the jpeg
                                          support and added the imageboxrot
                                          call

David Goehrig   dave@valinux.com          libtool, and autotools assistance,
                                          God of all things Freshmeat and
                                          assistance with imaging code

Doug Jackson                              had ideas bounced off him a lot
                                          because he understands a lot about 
                                          black and white tiff imaging

Evan Nemerson	evan@coeus-group.com	  fixed an error with the textbox
					  implementation which caused it to
					  sometimes lockup

Juan Herrero    juan_herrero@yahoo.com    bug reports
                                          lots of work and suggestions for 
                                          the Windows compilation issues in 
                                          0.4 RC3

Michaelw        [irc.freshmeat.net]       suggested how to fix the examples
                                          being made before the library

Mirar            mirar@mirar.org          was good enough to point out some
                                          usability issues with the 0.3.1
                                          release

Phillip Rainey                            helped with the web page and had code
                                          ideas bounced off him at various
                                          stages. The ActiveX porting work.
