Welcome to the seemingly never ending Panda TODO list. The format for this file
is a simple list of tasks that need to be completed. There are also the
following symbols defined to the left of the *'s, which have the following
meanings:

  K - release killer. The current development release of Panda will not be
	released for production use until this problem is resolved
  N - something that is expected to be fixed by the next major release of
	Panda (after the one which we are working on now)
  L - low priority, will one day be done.

A lack of a symbol to the left merely means that I have not decided what it's
priority is yet, and that it will oneday get done.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

N * Further improve font handling so that font changes are minimised (change
	the order text boxes are drawn in so that the font need only be defined
	once per page).

  * Callback for error handling implementation.

  * Be a bit more sensible in some of our error handling, for instance, if we
  	can't find a file to include in the PDF we shouldn't exit -- we should
	report it to the calling function and let them deal with it...

N * Linearisation (also known as optimised PDF)

  * Validity checks for things like names

N * TIFF support does not currently include the following compression options:
	- Flate
	- LZW (never!)
	- Packbit

N * More work on the lexer

L * New font ids are handed out too often -- what about font reuse?

  * Handle image reuse better

  * At the moment if we can't change font we stop the whole schmozzle - should
	we just report an error and keep going in the old font?

  * Re run GNU indent

  * Lines and stuff...
	The following operations in graphics mode are needed (p 159):
		- w (set the line width)
		- J (set the line cap)
		- j (set the line join style)
		- M (set the mitre limit)
		- d (set the dash pattern)

  * AM_CONFIG_HEADER problems

  * String length measuring with Freetype so that textboxes wrap nicely...

  * More freeing of memory than we do now

  * If you set the character spacing or something like that to a very
	negative number, then we should complain in some way...

  * Save the state that someone is built for lines and curves and stuff, and
	allow them to restore that state later on if they would like to...

  * Memory leaks

  * Empty pages (including template pages) cayses the demo application to
	crash with a Seg Fault. What is different between a newly initialised
	page and one later on?

  * Make sure the date code is portable...

  * Need to handle the absense of headers when libraries are not installed.

  * PNG images have their alpha channel ignored, with the background colour not
	being used. PDF does "poor man's alpha channelling", which we should 
	try to support...

  * Template pages don't work yet

  * Colour TIFF support

  * Forced cascading properties

  * Document wide properties (convenience)

  * Windows uses _snprintf instead of snprintf - Juan Herrero 
	<juan_herrero@yahoo.com>

  * Windows wont use my time code - Juan Herrero <juan_herrero@yahoo.com>

  * Include path problems on Windows - Juan Herrero <juan_herrero@yahoo.com>

  * Error callback (including on Windows) - Juan Herrero <juan_herrero@yahoo.com>

  * Windows version of libpng - Juan Herrero <juan_herrero@yahoo.com>

  * M_PI needs to be #defined on Windows boxen - Juan Herrero <juan_herrero@yahoo.com>

  * Windows mutexs - Juan Herrero <juan_herrero@yahoo.com>

  * If defined WINDOWS is not needed if the PDF is opened in binary mode - 
	Juan Herrero <juan_herrero@yahoo.com> [binary mode now used, remove
	unneeded #if defined WINDOWS's]

  * snprintf() usage in printing functions in utility.c
