<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para>This function records information within the PDF indicating the maximum number of seconds that the given page should be displayed within the viewer. This is useful for presentations and the like where you might like to automatically move onto the next page in the document at some point. The default value for this is to never move onto the next page automatically. If this value is changed from the default, there is currently no way to revert back to the default later. The feature may not be implemented by all viewers.</para>
