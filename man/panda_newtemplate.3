.SH NAME
panda_newtemplate \- create a template page in the PDF
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
 #include&lt;panda/constants.h&gt;
 #include&lt;panda/functions.h&gt;
 void panda_newtemplate(panda_pdf *document, char *pageSize);
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function is used to create 'template' pages which can then be refered to on other pages. For instance, if you were creating a document that used a standard letter head, then it would make sense to construct the letterhead as a template, and then use this on all the pages. The created template looks and feels just like any other page in the document for the purposes of creating content. Refer to the <command>panda_newpage</command> man page for details on how to use pages.
.SH "RETURNS"
.PP
A pointer to the template page
.SH "EXAMPLE"

 document = panda_open("filename.pdf", "w");
