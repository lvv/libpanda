.TH "PANDA_PRINT" "3" "29 April 2003" "" ""

.SH NAME
panda_print \- output a simple string to the PDF file
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
 #include&lt;panda/constants.h&gt;
 #include&lt;panda/functions.h&gt;
 void panda_print (panda_pdf * file, char *chars);
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
<command>PANDA INTERNAL</command>. This function call behaves just like <command>putc</command>(), but the output goes to a PDF file, instead of to stdout. It also writes more than one character at a time to the file, which is faster than doing this with a panda_printf.
.SH "RETURNS"
.PP
Nothing
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf
 This is an internal function which will only be needed by those playing deeply with Panda itself, so I won't provide an example.
.fi
