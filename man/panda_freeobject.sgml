<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para>&lt;command&gt;PANDA INTERNAL&lt;/command&gt;. This function call frees the memory used by an object. It is used during the cleanup process prior to finishing closing a PDF document. Even if a user of the API has added object types to their code, they should not have to call this function, as their objects should be added to the object tree via &lt;command&gt;panda_addchild&lt;/command&gt;() to ensure they are written to disc by &lt;command&gt;panda_writeobject&lt;/command&gt;() having been traversed by &lt;command&gt;panda_traverseobjects&lt;/command&gt;() at PDF close time.</para>
