<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para><command>PANDA INTERNAL</command>. This function call frees the memory used by an object. It is used during the cleanup process prior to finishing closing a PDF document. Even if a user of the API has added object types to their code, they should not have to call this function, as their objects should be added to the object tree via <command>panda_addchild</command>() to ensure they are written to disc by <command>panda_writeobject</command>() having been traversed by <command>panda_traverseobjects</command>() at PDF close time.</para>
