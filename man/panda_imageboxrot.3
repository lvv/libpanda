.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function call inserts an image into the PDF document at the specified location, including the ability to rotate the image on the page. It should be noted that xpdf will sometimes make the rotated image look quite sickly. This is in fact a bug in xpdf (which has beenr eported), and not a bug in <command>Panda</command>. The image types accepted by this call are: panda_image_tiff, panda_image_jpeg and panda_image_png.

Nothing

 if ((demo = panda_open ("output.pdf", "w")) == NULL)
 panda_error (panda_true, "demo: could not open output.pdf to write to.");
