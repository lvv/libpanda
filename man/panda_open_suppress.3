.TH "PANDA_OPEN_SUPPRESS" "3" "29 April 2003" "" ""

.SH NAME
panda_open_suppress \- open a PDF document with some special options
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
 #include&lt;panda/constants.h&gt;
 #include&lt;panda/functions.h&gt;
 panda_pdf * panda_open_suppress (char *filename, char *mode);
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
<command>PANDA INTERNAL</command>. Open the named PDF document with the mode specified. The only mode currently supported is "w", but others will be integrated later. The interface to this function is identical in it's behaviour to the <command>fopen</command>() function call offered by the ANSI C standard IO library. This function call additionally doesn't create any of the default objects that a panda_open would create, which is useful when you want to parse an existing PDF into a new document.
.SH "RETURNS"
.PP
A pointer to a panda_pdf structure
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf
 #include&lt;panda/constants.h&gt;
 #include&lt;panda/functions.h&gt;
 
 panda_pdf *document;
 
 panda_init();
 
 document = panda_open_suppress("filename.pdf", "w");
.fi
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
