.SH NAME
setfontsize
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <panda.h>
.sp
.BI "void setfontsize(pdf *, int size);"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.B setfontsize
sets the text size, which is expressed in points. The font size, once set, is 'sticky' and therefore apply to all text boxes created after the text size is set. You will therefore need to change the text size back (possibly to the default) if you no longer want to draw with that leading. The default value is 16 points.
.SH EXAMPLE
.br
Simply use:
.RS
.nf
#include <panda.h>

pdf *document;

document = openpdf("filename", "w");
setfontszie(document, 42);
.fi
