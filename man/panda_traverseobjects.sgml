<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para><command>PANDA INTERNAL</command>. This function traverses the object tree created by <command>panda_addchild</command>() and repeatedly calls the function defined as a callback. The traversal has a direction as defined by: panda_up (bottom up) or panda_down (top down). This call is commonly used by <command>panda_close</command> to call <command>panda_writeobject</command>() and <command>panda_freeobject</command>(). API users might also find it useful, although I wouldn't know why.</para>
