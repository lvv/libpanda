.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function records information in the output PDF document requesting that the viewing application fit the display window to the first page of the PDF document when it is opened. This option is not supported by all viewers, and therefore should not be relied upon. The on or off arguement is a panda_true value, which does the obvious thing. The default is to not fit the document to the window.

Nothing
