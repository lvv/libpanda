.SH NAME
panda_traverseobjects \- traverse the PDF object tree and perform an operation
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
 #include&lt;panda/constants.h&gt;
 #include&lt;panda/functions.h&gt;
 void panda_traverseobjects (panda_pdf * output, panda_object * startObject, int direction, traverseFunct function);
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
<command>PANDA INTERNAL</command>. This function traverses the object tree created by <command>panda_addchild</command>() and repeatedly calls the function defined as a callback. The traversal has a direction as defined by: panda_up (bottom up) or panda_down (top down). This call is commonly used by <command>panda_close</command> to call <command>panda_writeobject</command>() and <command>panda_freeobject</command>(). API users might also find it useful, although I wouldn't know why.
.SH "RETURNS"
.PP
None
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.nf

 panda_pdf *document;
 
 panda_init();
 
 document = panda_open("filename.pdf", "w");
 
 ... create a whole bunch of objects and add them to the tree ...
 panda_traverseobjects(document, document->catalog, panda_down, panda_writeobject);
