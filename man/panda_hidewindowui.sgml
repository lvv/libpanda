<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para>This function records information in the output PDF document requesting that the viewing application's window user interface not be displayed when this PDF is opened. This option is not supported by all viewers, and therefore should not be relied upon. The on or off arguement is a panda_true value, which does the obvious thing. The default is to display the user interface.</para>
