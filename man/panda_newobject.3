.PP
<command>PANDA INTERNAL</command>. Create a new object within the PDF document output. The types of object are panda_object_normal and panda_object_placeholder -- the difference is that a placeholder object wont be written out when the PDF is dumped to disc.

If this is the case, then these users are encouraged to submit their code changes back to mikal@stillhq.com for inclusion with the next release of <command>Panda</command>, and are reminded of their obligations under the GNU GPL.
