Properties are a way of specifing things about objects. These properties can have either a cascade scope (they affect all subsequently created objects that are children of that object) -- <command>panda_scope_cascade</command>, or local (they only occur for that object) -- <command>panda_scope_local</command>. Possible properties are defined in the <command>panda_const_properties</command> manual page.
