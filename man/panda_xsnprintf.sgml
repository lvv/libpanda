<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para>&lt;command&gt;PANDA INTERNAL&lt;/command&gt;. This command behaves like a slightly modified version of &lt;command&gt;vsnprintf&lt;/command&gt;. The main difference is that if catches the various different ways that errors can be returned, and turns these into a single NULL is a string big enough to hold the formatted string could not be allocated. </para>

<title>EXAMPLE</title>
