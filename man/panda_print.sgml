<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para><command>PANDA INTERNAL</command>. This function call behaves just like <command>putc</command>(), but the output goes to a PDF file, instead of to stdout. It also writes more than one character at a time to the file, which is faster than doing this with a panda_printf.</para>
